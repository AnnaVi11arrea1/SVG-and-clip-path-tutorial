            <p>Welcome on board! If you are reading this there is a good chance you have an interest in learning
                how to create implement graphics on your website. This tutorial will cover the basics of SVG and Clip-Path
                and how to use them in your website. We will also cover the differences between the two and when to
                use them. Let's get started!

            <h2>Definitions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SVG:</strong> (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a vector graphic that is used to create images and animations. The graphic
                    defines the area of the image and can be scaled to any size without losing quality. Excellent for graphic 
                    design and animations.</li>
                <li><strong>Clip-Path: </strong>is a basic shape. Used to hide or show parts of an image or element. Good for simple, fast design.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>SVG vs. Clip-path</h2>
            <p>Which one do we use, and what can we do with them?</p>

                        <li>Be careful not to overdo it, as too many animations can be
                            overwhelming to the user, and distract from the content of the site.</li>
