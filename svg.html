        <h2>Using SVG files</h2>
        
        <p>First you will need an svg file. This will be a file that you add to your directory. Here is one that I created:
            <img src="images/hexagons.svg" alt="hexagons" class="hexagons">
        </p>
        <div>* If you just want a vector for your own testing purposes, chatGPT may be able to create you something.</div>
        <p>Now that you have your svg file, you can add it to your HTML file just like you would an image, and assign it a class
            to apply specific CSS properties.
            <br>
            <br>
            Lets say you want to cut this object shape out of the background, to create a sort of outline or silouette.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have created a div element with a class="bgone" property in CSS. To use the svg file on this element, 
            make sure the element it is being applied to has a height, width, and background color property so you
            see the changes. Here is what that might look like: </p>
        
            <div class="teaser">
                <img src="images/hexagonclass.png" alt="svg" class="snippet">
                <div class="bgone">
                </div>
            </div>
       
        <p>So, what is happening here?</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The svg file is being applied to the background of the div element with the class "bgone".
                The svg area is the part of the background that is allowed to show through. So we are actually only 
                seeing a small area of the background, relatively speaking.
            </li>
            <li>
                It creates a sort of stencil effect. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Now you have the power to make your svg file any color you like by tweaking the background! Be sure to
                play with the properties.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Here is a little teaser:</h2>
        <div class="teaser">
            <div class="bgtwo">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <img src="images/animatebgtwo.png" alt="code snippet" class="snippetbgtwo">
        </div>
        <p>So, without having extensive animation knowledge, you can do some pretty cool stuff. A nice website for
            finding some animations is:
            <a href="https://animania.info/css/center-revolve">Animania</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            If you really wanna have some fun, try layering the clip paths and divs inside eachother, you can stack them to
            make wild patterns. The application here is just for fun, and becuase we can! Don't forget the CSS :before and :after
            methods for some extra spice. 
        </p>
